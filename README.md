Here I will upload the weekly updates of the tasks for Web Technologies Subject

Until now (06/11/2024), implemented things are:
-HTML (Divs, Classes, IDs, Forms, Tables, Images, NavBar...)
-CSS Basic (Padding, Marging, Borders, Color, Fonts...)
-CSS Advanced (Gradients, Shadow, Buttons, Rounded Corners...)
-JavaScript (Variables, Arithmetics, Functions, Conditions, Loops...)

The main page is "index.html", where I try to implement all the things we learn, making an article about my city, Ceuta. 
In that article, I also linked another tasks:
-Form
-Calculator
-RGB Selector
